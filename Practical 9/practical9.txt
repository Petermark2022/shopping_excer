This exercise explores how to develop a shopping website with multiple tables to hold your data, 
and to ensure that the components work together. 
This application gives you some starter code for the basics, 
so that you have something to work with in the exercise. 
As youâ€™ll see some parts are broken, and need some work in order to display the correct values. 
Work through the exercise at 
https://github.com/scharlau/shopping_exercise_p 
and see how larger applications work.
